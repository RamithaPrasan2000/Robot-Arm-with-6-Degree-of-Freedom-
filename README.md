# Robot Arm with 6 Degrees of Freedom 

I worked on this project with three electronic engineering undergraduates during semesters 3 and 4. First, we analyzed existing robot arms and the theory behind them. I contributed as the mechanical design engineer. Finally, our team exhibited the project at the EXMO 2023 technological exhibition.
